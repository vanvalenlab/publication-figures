This repo contains the code to reproduce the figures from Greenwald, Miller et al.

Some plots require access to the TissueNet dataset, and are currently commented out. Once the dataset is made available we will update the corresponding sections of the code.

The data to generate the figures can be found [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/publications-data/mesmer-preprint/mesmer_publication_data.zip): please download it and place it in the top-level directory for the example code to run correctly.
