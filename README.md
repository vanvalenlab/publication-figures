Recreate the figures from https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/505032v3 in 4 easy steps!

1) To create the figures, first place all JSON benchmarking data in a folder at the same level as `graph_creation.py`. In this repo, the folder is called `new_data`, but that can be changed inside `graph_creation.py`.
2) Edit the global variables in `graph_creation.py` (the ones with names in all caps) to suit your tastes.
3) Install all required python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4) Execute `python3 graph_creation.py`.

Note that we did a significant amount of aesthetic primping in Illustrator to these generated these figures before we put them in the paper, but the data is all the same.
